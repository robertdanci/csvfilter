Given are two CSV files containing a list of transactions, where each transaction is uniquely identified
by the SOURCE, ID and TYPE columns.

The filter() method of the CsvFilter class has three parameters, where the first two are the URIs pointing to
two input CSV files and the third one is a URI specifying where the output should be saved.

Implement the filter() method of the CsvFilter class, so that the output file contains a set of the unique transactions
appearing in the two input files ordered by the timestamp in ascending order. You should not modify the signature of the method.

Your solution will be graded based on the correctness, simplicity and clarity of the code and compliance with
the best practices. You should not spend more than one to two hours on this assignment.
